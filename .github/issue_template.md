The Joda-Time project has been running for many years now, and the codebase is stable.
Java SE 8 contains a new date and time library that is the successor to Joda-Time.
As such Joda-Time is primarily in maintenance mode and there are few things worthy of being raised as an issue.

**As a general rule, you should raise a question at Stack Overflow, not here.**

Before raising an issue, please check the [FAQs](http://www.joda.org/joda-time/faq.html).
Please also search Stack Overflow and the issue history at GitHub.
In particular, if the issue is Android specific, you are unlikely to get any assistance here.
Please bear in mind that I work on Joda-Time in my spare time, so there is no guarantee on response time.

In the unlikely event you still think you've found an issue, please delete the text above and describe the problem as follows:
