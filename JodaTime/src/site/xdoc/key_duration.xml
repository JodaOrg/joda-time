<section name="Duration">

<p>
A <i>duration</i> in Joda-Time represents a duration of time measured in milliseconds.
The duration is often obtained from an <a href="key_interval.html">interval</a>.
</p>
<p>
Durations are a very simple concept, and the implementation is also simple.
They have no <a href="key_chronology.html">chronology</a> or time zone, and consist
solely of the millisecond duration.
</p>
<p>
Durations can be added to an <a href="key_instant.html">instant</a>, or to either
end of an interval to change those objects.
In datetime maths you could say:
<source>
      instant  +  duration  =  instant
</source>
</p>
<p>
Durations implement <code>Comparable</code> which compares the lengths of the two durations.
</p>

<section name="Using Durations in Joda-Time">
<p>
Within Joda-Time a duration is represented by the
<a href="api-release/org/joda/time/ReadableDuration.html">ReadableDuration</a> interface.
There is one implementation of the interface provided:
<ul>
<li><a href="api-release/org/joda/time/Duration.html">Duration</a> -
An immutable implementation</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The code can be used in various ways:
<source>
DateTime start = new DateTime(2004, 12, 25, 0, 0, 0, 0);
DateTime end = new DateTime(2005, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0);

// duration in ms between two instants
Duration dur = new Duration(start, end);

// calc will be the same as end
DateTime calc = start.plus(dur);
</source>
</p>
<p>
Note that the interface <code>ReadableDuration</code> should not be used like the collections API.
The interface only contains the core subset of the operations.
Instead, you should usually refer directly to the implementation class in your APIs.
</p>

<subsection name="Nulls">
<p>
Joda-Time defines a null duration as zero length.
Thus, when a method is defined as taking a <code>ReadableDuration</code>, passing null in
will be the same as passing in a zero length duration.
