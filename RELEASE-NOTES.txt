Bug fixes in 2.9.2
------------------
 - Fix bug in time-zone binary search [#332]

 - DateTimeZone data updated to version 2016a (version 2.9 had time-zone data 2015g)

 - Minor fixes to code internals [#339, #326, #344, #350, #343]
 
 - Better document behaviour [#325]


Bug fixes in 2.9.1
------------------
- Fix bug introduced by Long.MIN_VALUE and Long.MAX_VALUE changes [#328]


Enhancements in 2.9
-------------------
- Faster parsing of time-zone identifiers [#282]

- Added Interval.parseWithOffset(String) [#299, #296]
  Provides a way to parse the fixed offset in an interval string

- Add DateTimeFormatter methods for StringBuilder [#298]

- Add Russian period translations [#320]

- Add Italian period translations [#312]

- Add Czech period translations [#313]

- Clarify that PeriodFormatterBuilder is in an invalid state once built [#309]

- Allow DateTime and Interval to refer to values at Long.MIN_VALUE and Long.MAX_VALUE [#297, #190]
  A DateTime may be created with any millisecond value, however at the very edges there may be
  some undesirable effects, for example always using UTC instead of the time-zone

- Better error message for malformed tzdb files [#319]

- Better error message for interval constructor [#321]


Compatibility between 2.8 and 2.9
---------------------------------
Build system - Yes

Binary compatible - Yes

Source compatible - Yes

Serialization compatible - Yes

Data compatible - Yes
 - DateTimeZone data updated to version 2015g

Semantic compatible - Yes


Bug fixes in 2.9
----------------
- Fixed to handle JDK 8u60 [#288, #291]
  Without this fix, formatting a time-zone will print "+00:00" instead of "GMT" for the GMT time-zone

- Fix parsing of basic form ISO style where year has unnecessary plus sign [#86]
  For example, +20151030 will now be correctly parsed as year 2015.

- Fix overflow bug in intervals [#315]



Scala
-----
Joda-Time uses annotations from Joda-Convert.
In the Java programming language, this dependency is optional, however in Scala it is not.
Scala users must manually add the Joda-Convert v1.2 dependency.
