Enhancements since 2.7
----------------------
- Encode properties files using unicode escapes [#228]
  The properties files are supposed to be loaded using ISO 8859-1 but Android seems to have issues with that.
  Re-encode the files using unicode escapes to sidestep the issue.

Deprecations since 2.7
----------------------


Bug fixes since 2.7
-------------------
- Fix MonthDay.plusDays() [#227]
  The algorithm was incorrect when adding enough days to cause the month to change twice.

- Fix DateTime.withDate() DateTime.withTime() [#233]
  The algorithm incorrectly changed the hour of day when certain DST dates were hit.
  The new algorithm avoids an IllegalInstantException when moving to a DST gap.

- Fix Period.parse() [#238]
  Negative periods of a fraction of a second were not parsed correctly.


Scala
--------
Joda-Time uses annotations from Joda-Convert.
In the Java programming language, this dependency is optional, however in Scala it is not.
Scala users must manually add the Joda-Convert v1.2 dependency.
