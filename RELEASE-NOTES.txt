Joda-Time version 2.2
---------------------

Joda-Time is a date and time handling library that seeks to replace the JDK
Date and Calendar classes.

This is the tenth release of Joda-Time.
This release contains enhancements, bug fixes and a time zone update.

We require JDK 1.5 or later as features such as generics are used.
It may be possible to use retroweaver to compile this under an earlier JDK but we haven't tried.

Joda-Time is licensed under the business-friendly Apache License Version 2.
This is the same license as all of Apache, plus other open source projects such as Spring.
The intent is to make the code available to the Java community with the minimum
of restrictions. If the license causes you problems please contact the mailing list.

Bug fixes since 2.1
-------------------
- MonthDay add/subtract [3528941]
  Addition and subtraction in MonthDay was fixed.
  It previously didn't work when the start value was 29th February.

- LocalDateTime.fromDateFields()
  This used to fail before 1970 when the input had a milli-of-second field
  Fixed to not throw an exception

- DateTimeFormatter.parseInto() [3522138]
  The v2.0 changes to handle parsing of month/day on their own (for Feb 29th) cause
  parseInto() to lose the year. This fix reverts behaviour to v1.x so that parseInto()
  will use the supplied year, not the default year of the formatter.

- DateTimeFormatter.isPrinter()/isParser() and related
  The Javadoc for DateTimeFormatterBuilder specified behaviour when the formatter
  could not print or could not parse, but the code didn't implement it
  Now it does, which means that DateTimeFormatter.isPrinter()/isParser() are now correct.
  The formatter will also now throw UnsupportedOperationException when unable to print/parse.

- Period formatter [3564249]
  Formatting did not correctly output values for negative milliseconds between zero and -1 second

- Parsing of US short time-zone names
  The time-zone names EST/EDT/CST/CDT/MST/MDT/PST/PDT/UT/UTC/GMT can now be parsed in a limited way.
  This is enabled for formatter patterns of "z" (and "zz" or "zzz").
  The builder continues to offer a better way of manually managing this.

- FieldUtils.safeMultiply(long,int) [3520651]
  Fix implementation to throw exception for (Long.MIN_VALUE, -1)

- Fix TestReadableDurationConverter [3515086]
  Test case didn't work if deafult time zone was UTC

- Javadoc fix to BaseChronology [3513326]

- Fixed Spanish translation of day for periods - dia now has accented i

Scala
--------
Joda-Time uses annotations from Joda-Convert.
In the Java programming language, this dependency is optional, however in Scala it is not.
Scala users must manually add the Joda-Convert v1.2 dependency.

All feedback is welcomed via the joda-interest mailing list.
