/**
 * An immutable time period specifying a set of duration field values.
 * <p>
 * A time period is divided into a number of fields, such as hours and seconds.
 * Which fields are supported is defined by the PeriodType class.
 * The default is the standard period type, which supports years, months, weeks, days,
 * hours, minutes, seconds and millis.
 * <p>
 * When this time period is added to an instant, the effect is of adding each field in turn.
 * As a result, this takes into account daylight savings time.
 * Adding a time period of 1 day to the day before daylight savings starts will only add
 * 23 hours rather than 24 to ensure that the time remains the same.
 * If this is not the behaviour you want, then see {@link Duration}.
 * <p>
 * The definition of a period also affects the equals method. A period of 1
 * day is not equal to a period of 24 hours, nor 1 hour equal to 60 minutes.
 * This is because periods represent an abstracted definition of a time period
 * (eg. a day may not actually be 24 hours, it might be 23 or 25 at daylight
 * savings boundary). To compare the actual duration of two periods, convert
 * both to durations using toDuration, an operation that emphasises that the
 * result may differ according to the date you choose.
 * <p>
 * Period is thread-safe and immutable, provided that the PeriodType is as well.
 * All standard PeriodType classes supplied are thread-safe and immutable.

     * If the period contains years or months, then the months will be
     * normalized to be between 0 and 11. The days field and below will be
     * normalized as necessary, however this will not overflow into the months
     * field. Thus a period of 1 year 15 months will normalize to 2 years 3 months.
     * But a period of 1 month 40 days will remain as 1 month 40 days.
     * <p>
     * The PeriodType parameter controls how the result is created. It allows
     * you to omit certain fields from the result if desired. For example,
     * you may not want the result to include weeks, in which case you pass
     * in <code>PeriodType.yearMonthDayTime()</code>.
     * 
     * @param type  the period type of the new period, null means standard type

     *  years or months but the specified period type does not support them
