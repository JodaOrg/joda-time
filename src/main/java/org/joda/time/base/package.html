Implementation package providing abstract and base time classes.
</p>
<p>This is a para</p>
<p>
Provides abstract implementations of the Readable* interfaces.
The Abstract* classes hold no fields and have no final methods.
They can be used by anyone wanting to implement the interface.
The Base* classes extend the Abstract* classes to provide fields for the
standard way to implement the class.
</p>
<p>
If you intend to implement a Readable* interface yourself, please consider
extending either the Abstract* or Base* class in this package.
