<section name="Ethiopic calendar system">
<p>
The Ethiopic calendar system is similiar to the
<a href="cal_coptic.html">Coptic</a> calendar and based on that used in ancient Egypt.
The calendar system is in use today in Ethiopia.
</p>
<p>
The Ethiopic calendar system consists of 12 months of exactly 30 days, followed by
a 5 or 6 day intercalary month making a year of 365 or 366 days.
Leap years (6 day intercalary month) occur every 4 years without exception (as per the Julian calendar).
They occur when the remainder left after dividing the Ethiopic year by four is 3.
The Ethiopic year starts on Septamber 11th/12th depending on leap years.
The epoch date for the calendar is 0008-08-29 (Julian), which therefore is 0001-01-01 (Ethiopic).
The current era is 'EE' (Ethiopian Era).
</p>
<p>
Joda-Time implements the rules described above.
We model the 5 or 6 day intercalary month as month 13.
We also prevent the entry of dates before year 1.

<section name="Using Ethiopic chronology in Joda-Time">
<p>
Within Joda-Time the Ethiopic calendar system can be used by obtaining an
instance of <a href="apidocs/org/joda/time/chrono/EthiopicChronology.html">EthiopicChronology</a>.
This is normally created via the
<a href="apidocs/org/joda/time/chrono/EthiopicChronology.html#getInstance()">EthiopicChronology.getInstance()</a> factory.
The chronology is then passed into the constructors of the main date and time classes.

// setup date object for midday on May Day 2004 (ISO year 2004)
DateTime dtISO = new DateTime(2004, 5, 1, 12, 0, 0, 0);

// find out what the same instant is using the Ethiopic Chronology
DateTime dtEthiopic = dtISO.withChronology(EthiopicChronology.getInstance());
