<section name="Time zone updates">
<p>
Time zones are a concept driven by the political situation in each country around the world.
As such, they change frequently, and often at short notice.
In order to manage this, Joda-Time uses the internationally recognised
<a href="https://www.iana.org/time-zones">tz database</a>, which is also used
in most operating systems and the JDK itself.
</p>
<p>
Using JDK time zone data is a problem however, as the zones are only updated when the
JDK is updated. This can cause issues if you are locked into an older version of the JDK.
</p>
<p>
Joda-Time also compiles the time zone data into our jar file. However, the key difference is
that you can update the raw data and recompile the jar at any time.

<section name="Updating the time zone data">
<p>
Firstly, download the latest version of the data files from
<a href="https://www.iana.org/time-zones">tz database</a>.
Ensure you select the "Data" download which comes as a tar.gz.
</p>
<p>
Secondly, you need a <a href="download.html">source code download</a> of Joda-Time.
</p>
<p>
Thirdly, you must take the time zone data files from step one, and replace those in the Joda-Time download.
They are located at <code>{root}/src/main/java/org/joda/time/tz/src</code>.
Note that only <i>some</i> of the files need to be copied across.
</p>
<p>
Fourthly, change the version number in the pom.xml file to indicate that it is a non-standard release.
</p>
<p>
Finally, recompile the Joda-Time jar file using maven.
Simply type <code>mvn package</code> in the root directory.
