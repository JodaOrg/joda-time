These are the release notes and advice for upgrading Joda-Time from
version 1.5.1 to version 1.5.2.
<source>
Joda-Time version 1.5.2
-----------------------

Joda-Time is a date and time handling library that seeks to replace the JDK
Date and Calendar classes.

This is a patch release for Joda-Time 1.5.1.
This release contains one bug fix and a time zone update.
We recommend all users of 1.5.1 upgrade to 1.5.2.

We recommend JDK 1.4 or later, and have performed no testing on earlier JDKs.

Joda-Time is licensed under the business-friendly Apache License Version 2.
This is the same license as all of Apache, plus other open source projects such as Spring.
The intent is to make the code available to the Java community with the minimum
of restrictions. If the license causes you problems please contact the mailing list.
